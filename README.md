# Analysis of Fatal Accidents in Australia

## Introduction  
This report presents insights from the analysis of fatal accidents in Australia between 2014 and 2021. The analysis aims to provide a better understanding of the trends and patterns of fatal accidents in the country and identify factors that contributed to the high fatality rates. The analysis is based on a dataset that includes 6787 fatal accidents that occurred during the study period. The report provides recommendations for improving road safety in Australia based on the insights obtained from the analysis.

## Gender distribution  
The dataset shows that males are more likely to be victims of fatal accidents than females, accounting for 73.54% of all fatalities, while females account for 26.46%. The high proportion of male fatalities highlights the need for road safety campaigns that target male drivers. 

## Speed limit
Exceeding the 100km/h speed limit was a contributing factor in 15.28% of all fatal accidents, while 84.72% occurred within the speed limit. This indicates that there is a need to enforce speed limits more effectively, especially in areas with a high incidence of fatal accidents.

## Holiday periods
During Christmas, there were 218 fatal accidents, while during the Easter period, there were 97. These figures suggest that there is a need for targeted road safety campaigns during these holiday periods to reduce the incidence of fatal accidents.

## Vehicle type
Articulated trucks accounted for 587 fatalities, while heavy rigid trucks accounted for 469. This suggests that there is a need to improve the safety of trucks on Australian roads, especially those involved in long-distance transport.

## Road type and Remoteness
National and state highways had the highest fatality rates, accounting for 1999 deaths and major cities which accounted for 2329 deaths. This suggests that there is a need to improve the safety of major highways and urban roads, especially those with high traffic volumes.

## State distribution
New South Wales (NSW) had the highest fatality rate, with 2306 deaths, while the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) had the lowest, with 51. This suggests that there is a need for targeted road safety campaigns in NSW to reduce the high fatality rate.

## Day of the week
Saturday and Sunday had the highest fatality rates, with 1177 and 1079 deaths, respectively. This means that weekends accounted for 39.21% of all fatalities, highlighting the need for targeted road safety campaigns during weekends, especially in areas with high traffic volumes.

## Yearly trend
The analysis shows that the number of fatal accidents has been decreasing from 2019 to 2021, with 1162 fatalities in 2019 and a decline in subsequent years. However, in 2014, there were only 295 fatalities, the lowest during the study period. This suggests that there is a need for continuous improvement in road safety measures in Australia to maintain the downward trend in the number of fatal accidents.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights obtained from the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve road safety in Australia:

1. Targeted road safety campaigns should be developed and implemented to reduce the high number of fatalities among male drivers, especially young males.

2. Effective enforcement of speed limits should be implemented, especially in areas with high traffic volumes and those with a high incidence of fatal accidents.

3. Targeted road safety campaigns should be developed and implemented during holiday periods, such as Christmas and Easter, to reduce the number of fatal accidents during these periods. Also this should developed and implemented in states with a high fatality rate, such as New South Wales, to reduce the number of fatal accidents.

4. Measures should be implemented to improve the safety of trucks on Australian roads, especially those involved in long-distance transport.

5. Measures should be implemented to improve the safety of major highways and urban roads, especially those with high traffic volumes.

6. Targeted road safety campaigns should be developed and implemented during weekends, especially in areas with high traffic volumes, to reduce the high number of fatalities during this period.

7. Continuous improvement in road safety measures should be implemented to maintain the downward trend in the number of fatal accidents as there was a downward trend from 2019 to 2021.


## Conclusion
The analysis of fatal accidents in Australia between 2014 and 2021 provides insights into the trends and patterns of fatal accidents in the country. The analysis highlights the need for targeted road safety campaigns to reduce the high number of fatalities, especially among male drivers, effective enforcement of speed limits, improvement in the safety of trucks on Australian roads. Continuous improvement in road safety measures is necessary to maintain the downward trend in the number of fatal accidents. These recommendations, if implemented effectively, can help to improve road safety in Australia and reduce the incidence of fatal accidents.
